          <h2>Why?</h2>
          <p>I know it can be nerve-wracking for people to start investing their own money into stocks out of fear they'll lose it all. I wanted these people to start investing with a sense of comfort and security. Plus, who doesn't like making money?</p>
      
          <h2>Things to be aware of:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A more improved algorithm than the one I have now (effective in both price and direction predictions rather than just direction)</li>
            <li>User auth so you can sign in, keep track of stocks you invest in, and view your profits/losses at the same time. Potentially through either MongoDB or Firebase</li>
            <li>Hopefully access to an even more advanced API to work with (minutes, seconds, hours of stock information)</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h2>There are certain errors you will encounter.</h2>
          <p>For example, the stock predictor only includes dates from January 23rd, 2023 to the date you're reading this right now. Also, if you put in today's date, you won't be able to see a prediction chart; however, this is something I am <span class="highlight">highly prioritizing</span>.</p>
      
          <h2>How does it work?</h2>
          <p>A magician never reveals his secrets (it's open source).</p>
